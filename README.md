# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts
In this project we're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.  Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. We will analyze which type of post and time receive the most comments on average i.e we need to advise on best hour to maximize the amount of comments a post receives  Our aim is to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:  Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
